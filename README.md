# CI-CD-simple-project

This simple project is about creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker. The pipeline will be triggered by a webhook from GitHub, which will then pull the code from the repository and deploy it to a remote server using Ansible to deploy the Docker container.
